<p><em>Author's Notes:</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the first chapter of Stygian Solace. I'll have you know that you're
in for a very long, plot-driven emotional ride of love, destiny, hope, and
betrayal. If you think you've stepped into a fanfic about pointless fluff and
humor, you're in the wrong place. While this <strong>does</strong> have romance and sex
and all of that yummy yaoi stuff, this fanfic deals with more deep emotions and
insanely twisted plots than normal fanfics.</p>

<p>This fanfic is an epic. It is <strong>NOT</strong> a novelization of Kingdom Hearts.
It has its own plot, written deep with KH's major themes, and while it has many
original ideas, it still loyally follows KH's true story. Stygian Solace may
start off slow with its first six chapters, but I assure you, the story does
pick up and it <strong>doesn't</strong> leave you with excess baggage. </p>

<p>Without further ado, here's the first chapter. ^^ And enjoy!</p>

<p><em>A look ahead:</em></p>

<p>A little game of Island War. Riku's Plan A? Hidden crushes and sandy butts.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong><em>Chapter 1: Exploiting the Horizon</em></strong><em> v. 3.0</em> (redone November
2003)</p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"Alright soldiers... Listen up!"</p>

<p>Exactly four pairs of eyes were focused on Tidus as he aristocratically
marched down the beach, his wooden staff slung over his shoulder like some sort
of military rifle. His five friends were sprawled out in different positions on
the sand below him, a few of them still trying to fully awaken for the day's
events. It was a particularly warm morning that lacked the normal island
breeze, and the air was dreadfully thick and sticky with humidity. So, to keep
their minds off the immutable weather, the blonde-haired boy had suggested a
game of Island War, and everyone had agreed.</p>

<p>Since he had decided on the morning's game, Tidus, of course, got to set the
rules and play General.</p>

<p>"This is no game!" Tidus barked, or at least tried to with his
early-teen vocal cords. Riku snickered at this. "I expect everyone to pay
attention, even <em>you</em> Cadet Riku!"</p>

<p>Riku lifted his head to grin up at General Tidus, raising one hand in a mock
salute. "Yes, <em>Sir</em>." Either Tidus didn't catch the sarcasm, or
he didn't care, because the boy went back to marching, satisfied with Riku's
response. </p>

<p>Riku had been the only one of the "platoon" who hadn't been paying
attention; rather, his eyes had been focused on more important things, like
say... Sora's hips. The boy had nice hips when they weren't being layered over
with his gaudy belts and chains, and right now, they weren't. </p>

<p>Actually the whole group had stripped out of their accessories and placed
them in a huge stack in the middle of the gathering, as per Tidus'
instructions, who had said that jewelry and the like were too noisy and
distracting for serious games like War. Riku actually had to agree, though he
had a feeling he was going to be distracted more by Sora now than he would have
been before.</p>

<p>Urk... Stupid hormones. They did strange things at strange times, and right
now they were telling Riku that Sora's boyish hips were awfully cute in his red
jumpsuit. Which was why Riku found himself staring at them. Which was why Tidus
had noticed and had confronted him, probably to warn him before Sora himself
noticed.</p>

<p>See, Tidus knew about Riku's growing love for his best friend --- love that
two best friends (especially when they were both <em>boys</em>) shouldn't have ---
and when he wasn't teasing Riku about it, Tidus was trying to help him hide it
from Sora until the time was right. Good 'ole Tidus.</p>

<p>Riku inwardly sighed, shifting slightly in the sand and draping one ungloved
hand over his knee. It was weird. The material of his pants. He rarely got to
touch it with his bare hands... It felt almost like rubber....</p>

<p>He had to do something about that.</p>

<p>"Two teams, as always," General Tidus was saying, kicking up sand
with his sandals as he marched to and fro down the line of soldiers. "You
can only carry one coconut at a time, but you may replenish that ammo whenever
you need to. Do not aim for heads or crotches."</p>

<p>Here Selphie giggled, and Tidus shot her a warning glare before he
continued.</p>

<p>"The whole island is the battlefield. However," he said, coming to
a stop in the middle of the line, jutting his chin out. "There's a new
rule this time. No getting wet."</p>

<p>There were a few muffled groans of protest, mostly coming from Wakka and
Sora's side.</p>

<p>"You heard me," Tidus sternly said. "No getting wet. If you
step in the waves, get thrown into a pool of water, or run under a waterfall,
you're dead. And one last reminder... No weapons! If you're hit by a coconut,
you have two seconds to fall and announce your death, during which time you can
counterattack. You must remain there until War is over. War is over when all
the members of one team are killed or captured. Alright. Are we ready to pick
teams?"</p>

<p>Sora shot to his feet, one fist in the air and his blue eyes wide with hope.
"Oooh! I wanna be a platoon leader! Me! Me!" he cried, his hips
swaying as he waved his hand maniacally around. "Come oooon, Tidus!"</p>

<p>Riku raised both eyebrows at Sora, hiding an amused smile as he watched the
boy practically hop up and down. He not only had cute hips, but his butt too...</p>

<p>Tidus, unfortunately, noticed the silver-haired boy's ogling. "Riku,
get up. You're the opposing platoon leader."</p>

<p>"Riku always gets to be leader!" Selphie whined, vocalizing Sora's
thoughts before he could.</p>

<p>The boy lowered his arm in defeat, blue eyes narrowing as his lower lip
stuck out in a cute pout. Hiding another smile upon seeing Sora's adorable
(almost irresistible) moping, Riku pushed himself to his feet and crossed the
short distance to stand next to Tidus.</p>

<p>"Alright. My team's the Crabs, Riku's is the Seagulls. I get first
pick," Tidus announced, pointing a finger at the remaining four cadets.
"Kairi and Wakka! That leaves Selphie and Sora on Riku's side. You have
ten minutes before War commences, so get started!"</p>

<p>The six children exchanged quick glances and words of challenge before they
scattered, Tidus and his comrades pattering across the warm sand towards the
pier to discuss plans. Warm sand indeed. Everything about today was hot
already. And, judging from the annoyingly-blue sky that only had a few sparse
puffs of cloud, there wouldn't be a break from the heat. Even more vexing was
that Tidus had added that stupid no-getting-wet rule, which meant, basically,
no cooling down. Suffering until the end of the game.</p>

<p>Blargh!</p>

<p>"Why seagulls?" Sora grumbled as he, Riku and Selphie were passing
under the bridge connecting the paopu isle to the rest of the island. </p>

<p>He kicked angrily at the sand before turning his blue eyes to stare at Riku,
who was already staring at him as he daydreamed about Sora's hips and cool
weather. He blinked upon being caught staring and turned his head to glance
ahead, hoping he looked casual about it. Sora brushed the incident aside, but
not before a faint veil of red fell over his cheeks as he continued. </p>

<p>"I-I mean, seagulls are stupid. Nobody likes them! Why can't we be the
sharks.. Or barracudas... or something cool at least."</p>

<p>"Why something natatory at all?" Riku laughed, glancing back at
Sora as he reached a hand out to muss the other boy's hair. </p>

<p>His bare fingers slipped through the spikes and he inwardly awed at their
softness. Oh what he would give just to be able to run his hands through that
hair all morning...! If only Sora didn't like Kairi, though. If only Sora liked
him back. If only Kairi wasn't there to interrupt their little adventures every
time the two boys were alone. If only...</p>

<p>"Natatory?" Sora innocently asked, his boyish voice breaking
through Riku's reverie.</p>

<p>"Er.. That is..." Riku faltered, mentally chiding himself for drifting
off into <em>LaLa</em> land. "Why does our team have to be named after
something marine-related?" As they passed through the doorway leading into
the cove, he added, "We could be the raptors or dragons."</p>

<p>Sora hesitated before stepping through, turning his head to give Riku a
bright smile. The silver-haired boy took in the smile, memorizing the details
of it; the curving of his lips, his adorable little cheeks, the way his eyes
lit up... </p>

<p>But ahead of them, Selphie's cutesy voice ruined the moment as she called back:</p>

<p>"But dragons stink!"</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>Thirty minutes. At least, around there. It couldn't have been less than
that.</p>

<p>It had been approximately thirty minutes since the game of War had commenced
and Riku's team had split apart to get into their positions, bidding each other
a "Don't get killed or you'll screw up the plan!" before they left.
From Riku's position perched precariously under the broken bridge, the heat was
almost unbearable, like sweltering knives ripping into his skin as he
impatiently waited for his enemy to pass over him. The water lapping against
the wooden posts of the bridge seemed to taunt him, flirt with him, begging him
to drop down and take a lap or two to cool off. But then, according to the
rules, he would be dead. </p>

<p>What, was the water a metaphor for molten lava in War or something? Why had
Tidus made up that stupid rule?</p>

<p>Ah, in any case, it was just another chance for Riku to trap his enemy. If
they couldn't get wet, that means they couldn't take the route under the
bridge, and would have to go over it if they wanted to get to the other side of
the island. That was why Riku was perched there, hidden under the planks in the
mid-morning shadows cast over him, so he could pull his enemies into the water.</p>

<p>That was how most of these War games turned out. One team would go hunting
with more of an offensive battle plan, while the other team would lay in hiding
with either an ambush plan, or a stealthy approach. And after an hour of hiding
or searching, the War would end in a suspenseful last battle. It always did end
quickly, even after all that careful planning. </p>

<p>Today Riku had formulated a mixture of defensive plans, but it all depended
on whether or not Selphie would survive as bait. As per Riku's instructions,
she had snuck over to the other side of the island to lure the other team to
where Riku was (after all, she was small and quite quick and could easily
outmaneuver them). </p>

<p>But that had been relatively soon after War had begun, and Riku was getting
uncomfortable in his position. Where the hell was she?</p>

<p>When Riku was beginning to think that he was thoroughly wet with sweat, he
heard conspiring voices coming from the direction where the tower that
overlooked the unfinished raft was. That was... unexpected. He had been
preparing for the enemy to come in the opposite direction, by way of the door
separating the Seashore and Cove, not through the small passageway below the
Treehouse that led to Star Tree used as a tag post during races. This was only
a slight hindrance in Riku's plans, however.</p>

<p>That's what he told himself, at least, until he actually saw his enemies at
the foot of the broken bridge. </p>

<p>Selphie was with them. </p>

<p>For a moment Riku was concerned --- had she been taken as a prisoner of war?
</p>

<p>But then he realized that she was smiling as the four of them whispered to
each other.</p>

<p>She had betrayed him! Switched sides!</p>

<p>That was worse than having her die on him! </p>

<p>Actually, it shouldn't have come as much of a surprise that Selphie had been
coaxed over to side with the enemy, considering she was easily charmed. If Riku
wanted something from her, all he would have to do was offer her something
meager in return. Like say a kiss on the cheek, or a seashell. Selphie was
easily amused. Riku idly wondered what Tidus had offered her to betray Riku. </p>

<p>A piggy-back ride?</p>

<p>But now he only had Sora to rely upon. </p>

<p>Well. Sora was more than enough. </p>

<p>Hmph. Riku would show them that he and Sora could still win, even with
double the odds against them. Four to two. Feh!</p>

<p>Shit. But Sora didn't know about Selphie's betrayal. What if he decided to
play hero or something and try to save her? Or what if she tried to trick him
and he believed her?</p>

<p>Riku had to do something.</p>

<p>But before he could, he noticed something peculiar. Wakka and Tidus were
carrying some thick wooden sticks, while Kairi and Selphie were carrying cloth
pouches with one coconut each, and they were climbing down the stairs to the
small beach under the broken bridge.</p>

<p>Shit. Shitshitshit!</p>

<p>If they came any closer, they would see Riku's hiding spot!</p>

<p>And then it clicked. Selphie! Selphie knew his plan! She must have told them
what it was, and where to find both him and Sora, and they were now planning to
pick Riku off first!</p>

<p>But how were they <em>doing</em> it?</p>

<p>Biting back the bitter anger of betrayal, Riku watched as Selphie casually
pointed in his direction, and Tidus looked up to study the broken bridge. The
blonde boy muttered something to his team mates before he turned his wooden
sticks vertical and grinned in Riku's general direction.</p>

<p>That was when Riku realized what the sticks were. They were stilts! So Tidus
and the others could walk <em>over</em> the water without worry of getting wet.</p>

<p>That was when Riku also realized that he had been set up --- that Tidus had
come up with that stupid no-getting-wet rule to force Riku into thinking inside
the box, which meant that he knew that Riku would think that Tidus would have
to cross over the broken bridge. Since Tidus knew Riku's plan ahead of time, he
can constructed a clever trap to manipulate Riku into exactly where he wanted
him.</p>

<p>Smart little bastard. Riku would have to give him credit later for tricking
him like that, but not before he got himself out of this mess. Somehow.</p>

<p>Tidus and Wakka were now adjusting their balance on their stilts as Kairi
and Selphie handed them their coconut ammo pouches to sling around their
shoulders. When that was done, as Tidus and Wakka began to wade into the
shallow water, the two girls ran back up the stairs and disappeared from
sight--probably to go get coconuts for themselves. After all, the rule said
that a soldier could only carry one coconut at a time.</p>

<p>Riku, from his position under the bridge, didn't even have a coconut. He
couldn't even take one of his enemies out.</p>

<p>Hm...</p>

<p>Just as the two stilt clowns were stopping directly in front of Riku's
hiding spot, the girls came running back, both with a coconut in tow, giggling
and looking pleased with themselves as they ran onto the bridge and positioned
themselves close to Riku.</p>

<p>He was surrounded now. Great.</p>

<p>"Come out, Seagull Commander!" Tidus called, using Riku's team
name. Pfft. Seagulls. Maybe Sora was right about that whole Island-War theme.
"We know you're there because we saw your silver hair a mile away!"</p>

<p>Wait, what? They could see him that obviously? Well, crap.</p>

<p>But there was no way he was going down without a fight. Riku <em>never</em>
lost.</p>

<p>The silver-haired boy slid down from his perch into the open, standing on
one of the crossing beams holding the bridge together as he stared at Tidus and
Wakka a few feet below him, who were having a bit of a difficult time keeping
their balance in the soft, wet ocean sand. The boys certainly looked like crabs
on their stilts, clumsily swaying to and fro like scuttling crustaceans. </p>

<p>A slow smirk crossed Riku's face.</p>

<p>Maybe it was time for Team Crab to see the benefits of being a seagull.</p>

<p>As Wakka and Tidus launched their coconuts at him, he leapt up and grabbed a
beam, bringing his legs up and letting their attacks pass harmlessly under him
before he dropped back onto his beam, grinning proudly out at the boys. </p>

<p>"Crap! Selphie, give me your coconut and go get some more ammo!"
Tidus cried, struggling to keep his balance as he glared at Riku. "Kairi,
don't just stand there!"</p>

<p>Selphie whistled and tossed her ammo down to Tidus, who carefully caught it
and managed to stay standing on his stilts. </p>

<p>But before the girl could run to get more, a coconut hit her from behind and
sent her staggering forward, dangerously close to the edge. She cried out in
surprise and spun around, as did everyone else, to find <em>Sora</em> standing
there at the foot of the bridge, casually waving.</p>

<p>"Didn't forget about me, did you?" he grinned.</p>

<p>Selphie whined and slumped to the wooden planks of the bridge, having gotten
hit by Sora's coconut.</p>

<p>"Selphie's down!" Kairi cried, fear creeping into her voice. She
seemed to know her situation wasn't too great, considering that Sora was one of
the more talented people at War. Her death in this game was inevitable, even
with Sora unarmed.</p>

<p>She squeezed her eyes shut and gave a weak whimper as she launched her
coconut at him to take him out, as though afraid of missing him, but afraid of
hurting him at the same time. </p>

<p>Sora, of course, easily ducked it and stepped onto the bridge, trapping
Kairi between him and Riku's position down below.</p>

<p>However, that didn't stay that way for long. </p>

<p>Taking Sora's appearance and everyone's distracted attention as his chance, Riku
vaulted from his beam and landed on Wakka, who cursed as he was thrown
off-balance. But they remained standing because, as Riku had hoped, while the
two boys had been standing there so long, their stilts had sunken into the sand
deep enough to create a suction that held them in place. Now the whole balance
problem lay with the boys' legs and feet, not the stilts themselves.</p>

<p>"Wakka's under attack!" Tidus cried and reached forward to help
his red-haired comrade out.</p>

<p>Riku used this to his advantage as well --- he <em>still</em> wasn't planning
on losing, after all --- and used all of his strength to push away from Wakka and
cling to Tidus instead. As planned, the oldest boy finally lost his balance as
Riku shoved him, and he fell off his stilts into the shallow water below,
leaving Tidus to contend with Riku alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back on the bridge, Sora lunged forward and gently grabbed hold
of Kairi's arm, pushing her over the edge. Kairi shot the boy a disbelieving
glare, as if she expected him to show her some mercy because they were close
friends, but then gravity took hold of her and she screamed on the way down. </p>

<p>Sora merely waved as she hit the water below. But then he saw Tidus and Riku
fighting for control on the stilts.</p>

<p>"Get off me, you crazy bastard!" Tidus cried, reaching out to pull
Riku's hair, who cried out as it was yanked and reached for Tidus' golden locks
in response.</p>

<p>"Fuck, Tidus! You don't have to cheat because you're losing!"</p>

<p>It was just the three of them left now, but from the looks of it, Sora would
be the only one surviving this round of War. The boy glanced around him,
frowning, searching for a solution. He had to save Riku somehow.</p>

<p>"Arggh! Let go, let go!" Tidus screamed. "I'll drop us both
into the water!"</p>

<p>But Sora was already climbing down into the beams of the bridge. Just as Sora
was at Riku's height, Tidus' resolve broke and he leaned back to fall into the
water, taking Riku with him. </p>

<p>Sora lunged forward, one hand holding onto a beam for support as his other
hand grabbed for Riku's arm as they fell past him like a tall tree crashing to
the ground. His gloved hand wrapped around the flailing limb and he held onto
it, planting his feet firmly against the beam and hoping his strength could
hold Riku.</p>

<p>Tidus dropped into the shallow water next to Wakka and Kairi, who were all
sopping wet and staring up at Riku and Sora with wide eyes.</p>

<p>The silver-haired boy brought his other arm up and grasped Sora's hand, who
slowly pulled him to the beam, relieved that Riku was alright. Their eyes met
as the elder boy hoisted himself onto the beam and for a moment they were all
that mattered to each other. Riku had fought bravely to win, Sora had been
there to save him, and they had both come out of it alive.</p>

<p>"We won," Riku said, a little out of breath from his escapade with
Tidus and almost falling to his 'death.' Sora gave him an adorable toothy grin in
response and pulled him into a tight hug, and they both broke into laughter.</p>

<p>Below them, Kairi had begun wading out of the water, looking miserable,
while Tidus complained to Wakka about how Riku always won. Selphie called down
to them, saying something about how pathetic they were that the four of them
couldn't even defeat Riku. </p>

<p>Sora and Riku exchanged glances again and grinned. But then Sora tilted his
head, noticing something.</p>

<p>"Hey, Riku, why are you all wet?" Sora asked, momentarily pulling
Riku away from his giddy victory. The boy reached out and brushed his ungloved
hand through Riku's damp silver hair. "I was afraid I was going to drop
you back there, not because you were too heavy, but because you were all
slippery."</p>

<p>Raising both eyebrows, Riku stared at his best friend. "Well, it was
really hot during those thirty minutes waiting under that bridge. What? You
don't like me wet with my clothes clinging to me?"</p>

<p>Sora promptly blushed. "Stupid."</p>

<p>"I know," Riku laughed, mussing Sora's hair as he grinned.
"But you know you wouldn't last without me."</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p><em>One... two... <strong>three</strong>!</em></p>

<p>He lugged the log up out from the underbrush and it flew into his arms from
the momentum, almost knocking him backwards into the small pool of water by the
secret place. </p>

<p>Riku silently laughed to himself, thinking that actually that wouldn't have
been such a bad thing. He could lounge around in the cool water, letting the
spray of the waterfall tickle his face as the cold enveloped him in its weightless
embrace. It sounded really good right now, but alas, he was busy. Busy
gathering last-minute construction material for his raft, that is.</p>

<p>He'd have time to swim later. Hmm... And maybe Sora would join him.</p>

<p>The afternoon was just as hot as the morning had been, but after Riku and
Sora had won Island War, Kairi had gotten pissy and given the two boys a vocal
list of materials to gather for finishing the raft. </p>

<p>It was almost like building the raft had been <em>her</em> idea. Actually,
when Riku had mentioned building a raft all those weeks ago, he had intended
for only him and Sora on going, <em>not</em> Kairi as well.</p>

<p>Oh well. If Kairi was going, then that meant Sora was guaranteed to follow. </p>

<p>Kairi. Grr.</p>

<p>But the day was way too hot to be doing this sort of manual labor. Riku
wouldn't complain though, because he was Riku, and nothing perturbed him
(except for perhaps some of Selphie's antics). Sora on the other hand was
probably lazing around somewhere, trying to keep cool. </p>

<p>Smiling to himself at the mental image, Riku shifted the log in his arms and
turned towards shore, immediately spotting a figure with spiky brown hair
laying there, basking in the sun with his face turned towards the sky. </p>

<p>Sora. As predicted. The boy was probably sleeping and having dreams about
chocolate milk shakes. He looked adorable laying there in the sand, arms behind
his head and the sun lighting up his tan face and almost making his red jumper
glow. He could even see the glint of the boy's crown necklace from this
distance, and it made him smile. </p>

<p>Riku was just taking a step towards him when he saw that Kairi had gotten to
the boy first, and now Sora was sitting up, staring at her as she leaned over
him with her hands clasped behind her back.</p>

<p>Kairi. The rift between the two boys.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to her, she was always there to ruin Riku's plans with Sora. </p>

<p>That had started way back when she had appeared so suddenly on the islands,
and back then, it had been just Riku and Sora, always competing over the
littlest things... Sora had looked up to Riku as a role-model, and Riku had
reveled in the attention he had received. It had been a perfect life. </p>

<p>But when Kairi had come along, Sora's eyes had filled with a new sort of
fascination; Riku was no longer the center of Sora's attention, and Kairi was
just another competition between them, with her as the prize to be won.</p>

<p>However, Riku didn't want <em>her</em>. He wanted something else.</p>

<p>He needed attention to survive. He <em>thrived</em> on the feeling of
importance. If Kairi were suddenly to return her feelings for Sora, what would
become of Riku? Sora wouldn't need his rivalry anymore. Sora wouldn't need <em>him</em>.
</p>

<p>Riku sighed and trudged towards the beach, his happiness fading away just
like it always did when he thought of the possibilities of Kairi and Sora's
relationship.</p>

<p>He heaved the log over the ledge and it dropped next to a daydreaming Selphie
in the sand, startling her out of her own reverie, no doubt romantic. To
Selphie, everything was romantic. </p>

<p>She sometimes even teased Riku about Kairi and Sora, asking which one he had
a crush on. It was a joke of course, but how funny it was that Selphie was
actually that perceptive to notice Riku's staring at Sora. Tidus had noticed.
Actually, Tidus <em>knew</em>. He was the only one who did know.</p>

<p>"Hey, that wasn't very nice, Riku!" she huffed in irritation, her
face turning a fine shade of pink nevertheless. Leaping to her feet, she shook
her brown locks and cried, "You got me all sandy!"</p>

<p>"You were <em>already</em> sandy," he managed to laugh, dropping
next to her and picking up his log. Teasing Selphie was always fun, but right
now he had more important things --- like separating Kairi and Sora. "I'll
see you later. Gotta deliver this first."</p>

<p>Selphie huffed again, but not without a smile as she got to her feet and ran
to the dock where she usually spent most of her day. With that done, he tucked
the log under one arm and headed over to Kairi and Sora, who were staring out
into the ocean and talking now. </p>

<p>They looked like a couple. It was so... sickening.</p>

<p>Really, something needed to be done about this.</p>

<p>Riku had actually formulated a plan, ever since he had admitted to himself
that he loved Sora in <em>that way</em>. </p>

<p>The first step was winning Kairi's heart. It sounded stupid, right? But it
was supposed to seem natural. Once she was infatuated with Riku, Sora would be
discouraged with Kairi and return his full attention to Riku, and then things
would be back the way they had been before Kairi had shown up.</p>

<p>See? It worked out perfectly in the end. That was the plan. </p>

<p>And Riku had been working on it for <em>years</em>. </p>

<p>The situation had only gotten worse with time, unfortunately; Kairi was
spending more and more time with Sora alone whilst Riku was being left out more
and more frequently. </p>

<p>And to top it off, Kairi didn't seem too thrilled about Riku at all --- a
major fluke in that plan of his. If Kairi didn't like him, then the rest of his
plan flopped.</p>

<p>As for Riku's feelings for Kairi...</p>

<p>She was an interesting gal, no doubt, but Riku didn't harbor much feeling
for her. She was a good friend most of the time, but to him, she was an
obstacle in his quest for Sora's returning affection. </p>

<p>Time was definitely running short, especially with their big adventure a
mere two days away. He was beginning to think that a new strategy needed to be
set --- a Plan B, perhaps. </p>

<p>Maybe this whole Plan A: "beat Sora to Kairi first so he pays attention
to you" plan was doomed to failure from the start. </p>

<p>In any case, something needed to be done quickly so that Sora wasn't lost to
Kairi forever. </p>

<p>Riku didn't know <em>what</em> he would do if they ran off together and left
him to wallow in solitude.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see it some day..." Sora was saying from his spot in
the sand. "Along with any other worlds out there! I want to see 'em
all!"</p>

<p>Riku smiled, feeling his spirits soar. Just two more days and the three of
them would be on the open sea, searching for those worlds. It was just like
Sora to say something like that, and it reassured Riku that Sora was saying it
even to Kairi because sometimes Riku doubted that Kairi believed they would
find <em>anything </em>--- that his dreams were worthless, just some <em>dream</em>
and nothing more. </p>

<p>Or perhaps she only pretended to doubt Riku, so that she could have Sora for
herself. But Sora's dedication and constant babbling about other worlds let
Riku know that he still supported his ideals, which was a small sign of hope
that the boy still wanted and needed Riku's rivalry and friendship. His love.</p>

<p>"So what are we waiting for?" Kairi said cheerfully, turning to
face Sora with a smile.</p>

<p>But now was time for Riku to continue with Plan A, which was the only thing
he <em>could</em> do before he came up with an alternate solution. </p>

<p>Well, other than confessing his love to Sora outright, but Riku would never
do that. No, it wasn't Riku's style, and therefore Sora wouldn't take him
seriously if he ever did. The boy would probably even be disgusted and then
definitely run off with Kairi. </p>

<p>In any case, if Riku ever did admit his love publicly, Selphie would
probably go into "uber-conspiracy" mode and make a huge soap opera
deal out of it. </p>

<p>Riku approached his two friends from behind and took a calming breath.
According to his plan, he needed impress them both with his charms, and just
slightly make them feel guilty for excluding him in their conversation while <em>he</em>
had been working.</p>

<p>"Hey!" he called, and his friends turned at his voice. Kairi's
happy expression fell when she saw him, but Sora immediately flashed him an
adorable smile. "Aren't you guys forgetting about me?" he asked,
placing a gloved hand onto his hip. They probably didn't know that was <em>actually</em>
one of his greatest fears: being left out. <em>Being alone</em>. "So, I
guess I'm the only one working on the raft," he said, managing a sheepish
grin as he crossed the sand towards Sora.</p>

<p>He tossed the log at the boy, who caught it and fell backwards into the sand
with a small cry of surprise. Stopping in front of Kairi, Riku leaned forward
and placed his gloved hands on his hips, his brows raising as his eyes narrowed
mischievously. "And you're just as lazy as he is."</p>

<p>Kairi rubbed the back of her head with one hand, giggling. "Hee hee. So
you noticed." But then she spread her arms wide, innocence gone, and said,
"Okay, we'll finish it together." </p>

<p>Right. As if she would lift a finger to help them, other than to point at
one of his faults or praise Sora's skills. She was like that.</p>

<p>But he hid a satisfied smile (yes! he most certainly had charmed them!) and
casually dropped onto the ground next to Sora and rested an arm on his knee,
just as Kairi pointed at them and said, "I'll race you!"</p>

<p>"Huh?" Sora uttered innocently. That boy had a talent for acting
adorable. It was as if he had been placed on Destiny Islands for the sole
purpose of tempting Riku. </p>

<p>Riku played off his stare as usual though, pretending to look and sound
exasperated.</p>

<p>"What? Are you kidding?"</p>

<p>Kairi giggled again, sounding ominously innocent, and said, "Ready?
GO!"</p>

<p>Another competition. It seemed their days were packed full of them, but this
didn't bother Riku nor Sora at all. It hardly fazed them. The two boys
exchanged quick looks before they simultaneously leapt to their feet and broke
off into sprints, Kairi already far behind them. As they ran, Riku cast a
satisfied grin over at Sora, whose attention was instead focused on the finish
line ahead.</p>

<p>Two more days and they would be free. Their raft would be done and they
would have all the time in the world to explore new worlds. With each other. </p>

<p>Now, if only Riku could get Sora to understand his feelings... without
making a fool of himself.</p>

<p>Then again, if only Kairi wasn't going with them. It would be a lot easier
then, because then Riku could slyly flirt all the time. Hah! He could imagine
Sora's startled reaction and blush.</p>

<p>Trying to burn the image into his memory, Riku slid to a stop in the warm
sand near the raft, managing a triumphant smile as Sora came jogging up after
him, defeat written clearly on his face.</p>

<p>"Man, not again..." the boy whined. He dropped onto the edge of
the unfinished raft and gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>Riku flopped down next to him just as Kairi caught up, the smile fading from
her face when she saw the two of them sitting there. Together. Stopping in
front of them, she scowled, putting on a mother-hen-ish facade.</p>

<p>"Sora, didn't I just get after you about being lazy? And now <em>you</em>,
Riku!"</p>

<p>The silver-haired boy shrugged nonchalantly, knowing she didn't really care
what Riku did, as long as it wasn't with <em>her</em> Sora. "I already got
my stuff," he said casually. "Sora left the log back on the beach
though. Stupid."</p>

<p>Sora frowned, lightly punching Riku in the arm. "I'm not stupid! And
since you're done, you can help me!"</p>

<p>Riku raised an eyebrow at that, a sly grin crossing his lips. "Aha...
Sure. The only thing I'm going to help you with today is shaping up that pudgy
belly of yours," he calmly replied. "How do you expect to attract
girls when you still have your baby fat?"</p>

<p>A furious blush ran over Sora's cheeks at Riku's words. "I'm
attractive!" he retorted, raising his eyebrows as he turned to get Kairi's
support. "Aren't I, Kairi?"</p>

<p>She giggled, patting him on the head. "Puppy-ish cute, Sora."</p>

<p>His shoulders sank and he turned his gaze to the sand. "Oh..."</p>

<p>Riku scooted closer to the boy and wrapped an arm around his shoulders,
leaning his face close to Sora's. "Don't worry," he whispered softly,
brushing a thumb over the boy's cheek, "I think you're sexy."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Sora gently pushed him away, that grin back on his face.
His tone was forced though, and Riku wondered if it was because Sora was really
disgusted and didn't want to hurt Riku's feelings, even if it was just a joke.
"Riku, that's not funny!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm sexy?" the silver-haired boy asked, putting on a
face of false innocence. Testing time. Was Sora really disgusted with him? He
got to his feet and slowly spun in a circle, giving them a short wink as he
modeled for them.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Sora replied dryly. "Almost as sexy as Wakka."</p>

<p>Kairi suddenly burst into laughter, Sora not far behind her.</p>

<p>"Well, well. I always knew you had a thing for red-heads, Sora,"
Riku teased, but not putting any emotion into it. His good mood had died as
soon as he had suspected Sora's discomfort. And now this. Sora's comment
practically confirmed his fears. </p>

<p>But… there was always a chance that Riku was reading his best friend wrong. Sora
<em>had</em> been acting rather blushy lately.</p>

<p>"Nah, not really," Sora said as he managed to calm his laugh, his
blue eyes gleaming with tears from laughing so much. "It just seemed funny
at the time. I like someone else."</p>

<p>Kairi's interest immediately perked up. "Ooo... Who is it? Are you
going to miss her when we leave on the raft?"</p>

<p>"I'm not telling!" Sora exclaimed, suddenly embarrassed as Kairi
leaned towards him for more information. Pfft. She was no doubt hoping he liked
<em>her</em>. But Sora turned to Riku, cheeks stained with a light hue of pink as
he asked, "W-What about you, Riku? Don't you like someone?"</p>

<p>"How can you be so sure?" Riku asked, managing a small smile. Did
Sora actually care, or was he only asking to escape Kairi's questioning gaze?
And there was that blush of Sora's again. It <em>was</em> happening a lot lately.</p>

<p>"My mom told me that all teenage boys direct their lust toward one
secret person that they remember for the rest of their lives. She says it's
because of the hormones. And you're almost sixteen, so speak up!" </p>

<p><em>His mom is always so knowing,</em> Riku mused, and wondered if Sora was
going to grow up with that almost mind-reading trait. Well, judging from how
Sora didn't already know Riku's feelings, Riku was safe for now. "Yeah, I
like someone..." he admitted slowly, with a light smile. "But you're
getting only one hint: brown hair."</p>

<p>"Brown hair? But that could be anyone from Selphie to that
three-year-old at the market!" Sora said, obviously disappointed at the
vague hint.</p>

<p>"Or me," Kairi pitched in with a smile. "Or your mom,
Sora."</p>

<p>Both of the boys cringed and gave her disbelieving looks.</p>

<p>"I can't believe you said that!" Sora laughed, rubbing at his
forehead. "That is... thoroughly disturbing. Ugh. Moving on... What about
you Kairi?"</p>

<p>"Oh, me...?" She hesitated, turning her face to stare out into the
sea. "Girls don't talk about their love lives with boys. Unless they're
gay. Or so Selphie told me. So neither of you are hearing anything from
me."</p>

<p>Riku cast a glance at Sora, who was suddenly frowning. Blinking at the look,
Riku wondered why Sora's mood had changed so suddenly like that.</p>

<p>Was Sora upset that Kairi wouldn't answer his question, or was it because
she had said something he hadn't liked?</p>

<p>"Anyway!" Kairi spun on Sora and narrowed her eyes, who glanced up
to meet her gaze, his dark mood gone. "You need to gather the parts of the
raft now! And don't even think about changing the subject again!"</p>

<p>As he watched the two of them, a smile slowly crossed over Riku's face.</p>

<p>Well, he'd get Sora to understand <em>somehow</em>. </p>

<p>The boy didn't have to like him back in return, though that would be great,
but Riku just needed him to <em>understand</em>... Keeping it to himself was
torture. </p>

<p>Once he had even considered asking <em>Tidus</em> for advice, or perhaps
telling Selphie outright about his problem... But, knowing them, they'd spread
the word and Sora would find out the wrong way.</p>

<p>Inwardly sighing, Riku waved Sora goodbye (who pleadingly looked up at him
to save him from Kairi), smiled, and headed off to his favorite spot to escape
the sweltering heat by lounging under the shade of the paopu tree. </p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>The sunset had dyed the ocean hues of fire, and the wind had finally picked
up to cool the islands down after a long day. Kairi, Sora and Riku were
lounging around the paopu tree, watching the sun sink over the horizon,
discussing their futures. Sora had mentioned something about Kairi's world,
bringing Riku's thoughts to other worlds again, wondering where she had come
from and how.</p>

<p>Riku wanted desperately to leave these islands.</p>

<p>"Could be," he said in response to Sora's comment. "We'll
never find out by staying here."</p>

<p>Genuinely interested, Sora leaned forward to look over Kairi's shoulder at
the silver-haired boy, his voice light with curiosity. "But how far could
a raft take us?"</p>

<p>So, Kairi's doubt was beginning to affect Sora too. Pretty soon she'd be
feeding Sora affection from her hands, both of them ignoring Riku or forgetting
him for good. </p>

<p>Still, Riku couldn't lie to Sora. Even <em>he</em> actually had doubts about
the raft idea. There had to be another way to get off these forsaken islands!</p>

<p>"Who knows?" Riku replied, lifting a hand casually as he spoke. He
had to sound like the leader. Like he knew. "If we have to, we'll think of
something else."</p>

<p>"So, suppose you <em>get</em> to another world," Kairi began, and
then paused to giggle, her legs swinging back and forth as she sat carefully
balanced next to Sora on the paopu fruit tree. She continued with a hint of cynicism.
"What would you do there?"</p>

<p>Riku noticed the "you" in her sentence rather than the
"we" that should have been there. Her question... It caught him off
guard. It sounded like she was testing him or something, trying to throw off
his suspicion of her under a guise of innocent giggling. Unsure of how to
respond, he used the first thing that came to mind.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't really thought about it."</p>

<p>Lame! Silently he cursed at himself. Whatever Kairi was trying, she probably
had gotten the right response out of him. For some reason, Riku had a feeling
she was trying to ruin his dreams, rebuke them as foolish, or try to make Sora
see that Riku's plans had no future. And so far, he had acted against his
plan... He was speaking too honestly. There was no way Kairi or Sora were
impressed with him now.</p>

<p>Shifting his weight onto his back as he leaned against the tree, he quickly
added, "I've always wondered why we're <em>here</em>, on this island. If
there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one?" </p>

<p><em>This prison surrounded by water,</em> he thought silently, crossing his
arms.</p>

<p>Instead he continued with, "And suppose there <em>are</em> other
worlds... Then ours is just a little piece of something much greater. So we
could have just as easily ended up somewhere else," he paused, looking up
at Sora with hopeful green eyes, "right?"</p>

<p>Sora tore his gaze away (had he been staring at Riku?!) and turned, falling
into a reclining position against the tree, his arms behind his head. "I
don't know."</p>

<p>He didn't seem to agree. Shit. </p>

<p>"Exactly," Riku said, a bit disappointed in Sora's reaction, even
if it was truthful. He had been hoping for a thoughtful response at least, not
some nonchalant truth. Riku pushed himself away from the tree, his arms falling
to his sides. "That's why we need to go out there and find out." He
took a few steps towards the edge of the small island to look out into the
water, his voice turning solemn as though he was muttering to himself.
"Just sitting here won't change a thing. It's the same old stuff."</p>

<p>And it was. Island War some days, grueling training other days, playtime
scenarios with knights and princesses... It was fun, yes, and Riku enjoyed
winning, but he was getting too old for it. As Sora had said earlier that day,
Riku was almost sixteen. What was he going to do with his life? Become a
fisherman like so many others? Or how about a businessman for some high-tech
corporation on one of the main islands like his father? Right. </p>

<p>Behind him, Sora watched him with an unreadable expression in his deep blue
eyes as Kairi shook the hair out of her face, seemingly unfazed by Riku's
statements.</p>

<p>"So let's go," Riku finished quietly.</p>

<p>"You've been thinking a lot lately, haven't you?" Kairi spoke up,
sounding curious. </p>

<p>Was she trying to reprimand him again? Never mind that, Riku's plan was
still in motion. He had to keep trying. Even if Riku couldn't lie to Sora about
his feelings, he could always lie to Kairi.</p>

<p>"Thanks to you," he replied as he turned to face her. </p>

<p>This was an obvious lie --- Riku had dreamt of visiting other worlds way
before Kairi had ever shown up. But Kairi didn't know that, and this suited his
purposes. </p>

<p>However, he noticed that Sora's eyes narrowed and his mouth opened as though
he wanted to cut in; Sora had seen through the lie, but the boy hesitated as
Riku spoke again. </p>

<p>"If you hadn't come here, I probably would have never thought up any of
this."</p>

<p>The air fell silent and Sora abruptly turned his gaze back to glare into the
sunset. </p>

<p>Kairi meanwhile was letting Riku's words sink in. So far so good...</p>

<p>"Kairi, thanks," he said finally with a hint of a smile.</p>

<p>She giggled in response, pretending to accept the compliment. "You're
welcome."</p>

<p>As soon as her words faded away and she paused to give Riku a friendly
smile, Sora sat up and shattered the romantic mood.</p>

<p>"Well," the brown-haired boy said with an obviously fake yawn,
"let's go home. I'm beat from running around all day. And I think Tidus bruised
my ribs..."</p>

<p>Riku glanced up at the other boy, noting the distant tone in his usually
cheery voice. It sounded almost mechanical. Had Riku said something that made
Sora angry?</p>

<p>Oh, the lie. Sora had seemed like he had wanted to say something when Riku
had spoken directly to Kairi... Was Sora acting jealous? But why would he be?
It was almost as though Sora was acting jealous that Riku was giving Kairi
credit for the whole "other worlds" idea.</p>

<p>The silver-haired boy stifled a sigh. The wrong message was being sent.</p>

<p>Riku didn't like <em>Kairi</em>... but that's obviously what Sora thought.
Which he was supposed to think, of course, according to Riku's plan. But with
Kairi not really returning Riku's fake affections, the plan wasn't working
anyway. And sometimes, it seemed like Sora wasn't acting jealous of Riku, but
of <em>Kairi</em>, which was totally strange.</p>

<p>There was no way Sora would be jealous of Kairi because Riku was giving <em>her</em>
attention. That made it seem like <em>Sora</em> wanted <em>Riku's</em> attention.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Sora was hiding under his own façade?</p>

<p>"Yeah, let's go," Kairi agreed, sliding off the tree onto the
ground. She exchanged a look with Sora before she headed towards the bridge.</p>

<p>Maybe it was time to set Plan B into motion. Maybe it was time for Riku to
try to express his feelings to Sora, before this whole thing turned into a huge
mess... </p>

<p>But how to <strong>do</strong> it?</p>

<p>Taking a look around, Riku spotted the answer. </p>

<p>How obvious! </p>

<p>As Sora dropped onto the ground to follow Kairi, his chain jingling as he
began walking, Riku quickly climbed the tree and reached for the ripest paopu
fruit from its top. He jerked it and its stem broke with a soft noise, and he
hugged the fruit to himself as he slid carefully back onto land. </p>

<p>Well, he might as well try. </p>

<p>If Sora didn't get this hint, then Riku didn't know <em>what</em> to do.</p>

<p>"Sora," he called as he caught up to the boy. </p>

<p>His heart was suddenly thundering in his chest, and he forced back a blush
as Sora turned. </p>

<p>This was the moment of truth. Sora <em>had</em> to understand…</p>

<p>Riku tossed the fruit at him and the boy caught it, staring down at the
yellow star with a confused look.</p>

<p>"You wanted one, didn't you?" Riku said, silently hoping his
message would get across. That Sora would understand that he liked <em>him</em>,
not Kairi. That the paopu was for <em>him</em>, not her, that he wanted to spend
the rest of his life with <em>him</em>, not her.</p>

<p>"A paopu fruit..." the boy asked, rather than said, his brow
furrowing as he stared at the smooth yellow skin of the fruit.</p>

<p>Riku started walking again, explaining without mentioning names to emphasize
his meaning, "If two people share one, their destinies become intertwined.
They'll remain a part of each other no matter what." His voice
involuntarily dropped at the last three words, momentarily revealing his true
emotions. Of course, that would only happen in front of Sora.... In order to
make up for his moment of weakness, which Sora <em>still</em> did not seem to
catch, Riku added with a laugh, "C'mon, I know you want to try it."</p>

<p><em>With <strong>me</strong>,</em> he silently added.</p>

<p>"What are you talking--" Sora began in a demanding tone, a tone
that almost sounded like disgust.</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>Breaking into a laugh and interrupting Sora before the boy could continue,
Riku ran ahead. </p>

<p>It probably sounded like Riku was teasing him, and that his laugh was a
casual laugh. But it was actually riddled with an emotion Riku rarely
expressed. </p>

<p>Fear. </p>

<p>He was afraid that Sora would never understand, that Sora would <em>hate</em>
him for his true feelings…. Or that Sora would be so confused because of Riku's
confession that he would approach <em>Kairi</em> with his feelings.</p>

<p>The paopu fruit was supposed to be an ultimate symbol of love, but it hadn't
worked. How <em>else</em> could he explain his feelings? What better way was
there than a paopu fruit? </p>

<p>There <em>wasn't</em> any, aside from the blatant truth.</p>

<p>And much to Riku's dismay, Sora casually tossed the fruit off the bridge
into the water and took off running after him towards the docks. </p>

<p>Sora had discarded it. Like some dirty sock. </p>

<p>He had thrown it away... a symbol of his love!</p>

<p>The rejection was an arrow through his heart, but he could only shake his
head and sigh.</p>

<p>Another wasted effort.</p>

<p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong><em>Everything</em></strong> in this fanfic has a meaning, even these first six
introductory chapters. These first six chapters are to introduce you to Riku and
Sora's friendship and growing relationship, and to make you comfortable with
them so that by the time you reach the <strong>real</strong> plot in the story, their
relationship is already familiar to you.</p>

<p>Because of this, the plot in these first chapters is kind of fluffy and
cute, and basically follows KH's plot, with a few changes. <strong>However, </strong>don't
expect that to last.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the first chapter. ^^ If you're new to Stygian
Solace, make sure you review as you read, as I work really hard on this fanfic
(I have plot! I have plot!) and feedback is very precious to me. </p>
